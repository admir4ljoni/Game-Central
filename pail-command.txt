Original dev command with Pail (not compatible with Windows):
npx concurrently -c "#93c5fd,#c4b5fd,#fb7185,#fdba74" "php artisan serve" "php artisan queue:listen --tries=1" "php artisan pail --timeout=0" "npm run dev" --names=server,queue,logs,vite

Note: This command requires the PHP pcntl extension which is not available on Windows.
If you need to use Pail, consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a Linux environment.
